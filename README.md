The goal of Your-Lab.ch is to (hopefully) lower the hurdle for beginners to get started with an IT project.  
Anyone can obtain a free third-level domain (subdomain) that they can manage independently.  

Currently, planned features will be either entirely free to use or have a free starting plan.
Our goal is that the cost per feature should never exceed 5$ a year.

## Available Record Types
- A
- AAAA
- CNAME
- TXT
- SRV

We do not provide MX records to prevent our domains from being blocked by anti-spam systems.

## Planned Features
Please keep in mind that these plans are more conceptual than concrete.   
They may change at any time and should not be considered a guarantee.  
- DynDNS
- Web Redirects (Subdomain redirecting to XYZ)
- URL-Shortener (With personal Your-Lab domain)
- Mail Redirect
